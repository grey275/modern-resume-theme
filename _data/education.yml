    I'm a self-motivated learner, and as a result much of my dev experience thus far has been self-directed, building small self-contained projects, and learning as much as I can about software development. I'm always seeking knowledge on both specific languages and frameworks that can be useful to me, and the general prevailing wisdom when it comes to building and maintaining software systems. As is common nowadays, much of my studies have involved isolated articles, guides, and tutorials found in various places on the web, but here are a few of the larger pieces of content I've enjoyed.

    __Books__:
      * The C Programming Language - K&R
      * Clean Code - Robert C. Martin
      * Code Complete - Steve McConnell
      * You Don't Know JS - Kyle Simpson
      * Don't Make Me Think - Steve Krug
      * Effective Python - Brett Slatkin
      * The Road to Learn React - Robin Wiruch

    __Courses__:
    * Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera, Andrew Ng)
    * Advanced Python (Pluralsight)
