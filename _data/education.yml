    My most productive and fun education experience thus far. Immersive, Up-to-date project-based learning. My time there complimented my pre-existing programming skills with practical knowledge of web-specific technologies, industry best-practices, and the skills required to build software effectively in a group environment.

    I'm a self-motivated learner, and as a result much of my dev experience thus far has been self-directed, building small self-contained projects, and learning as much as I can about software development. I'm always seeking knowledge on both specific languages and frameworks that can be useful to me, and the general prevailing wisdom when it comes to building and maintaining software systems.
